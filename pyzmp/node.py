### IMPORTANT : COMPOSITION -> A SET OF NODE SHOULD ALSO 'BE' A NODE ###
### IMPORTANT : IDENTITY
### Category Theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory

### Data Flow with topic :
#
# object : message
# arrow : topic_listener
# binary op - associativity : listener l1, l2, l3 <= (l1 . l2) .l3 == l1. (l2. l3)
# binary op - identity : noop on listener => msg transfer as is
# -> Expressed in programming language (functional programming follows category theory) :
# msg3 = topic2_listener(topic1_listener(msg1))

# -> Expressed in graph :
# msg3 <--topic2_listener-- msg2 <--topic1_listener-- msg1

### RPC with services :
#
# object : (req, resp)
# arrow : service_call
# binary op - associativity : service s1, s2, s3 <= (s1 . s2) .s3 == s1. (s2. s3)
# binary op - identity : noop on service => (req, resp) transfer as is ( two ways comm )
# -> Expressed in programming language (functional programming follows category theory) :
#  (req3, resp3) = service2_call(service1_call((req1, resp1)))

# -> Expressed in graph :
# msg1 --service1_call--> msg2 --service2_call--> msg3

###### higher level for execution graph to be represented by a category ######

# TODO : CAREFUL topic is probably not a complete concept in itself
# => often we need to get back to pub / sub connections rather than dealing with "topics"
# We need the reverse flow of "service call" which is a distributed generalisation of function call
# We need the distributed generalisation of the callback function ( async calls and futures )

### Service is a first class citizen. node is abstracted in that perspective : implementation requires some discovery mechanism.
# object : service
# arrow : call
# binary op - associativity : call c1, c2, c3 <= (c1 . c2) .c3 == c1 . (c2 . c3)
# binary op - identity : ??? TODO
# -> Expressed in programming language (functional programming follows category theory) :
#  svc1 = lambda x: return ( lambda y: return svc3(y) )( x )  <= currying/partial => svc1 = lambda x, y : return svc23(x,y)

# -> Expressed in graph :
# svc1 --call--> svc2 --call--> svc3

### Node is a first class citizen
# object : node
# arrow : topic_listener / callback
# binary op - associativity : callback cb1. cb2. cb3 <= (cb1 . cb2) . cb3 == cb1 . (cb2 . cb3)
# binary op - identity : ??? TODO
# -> Expressed in programming language (functional programming follows category theory) :
#  node1.cb = lambda x: return ( lambda y: return node3.cb(y) )(x) <= currying/partial => node1.cb = lambda x, y : return node23(x,y)

# -> Expressed in graph :
# node3 <--topic_cb-- node2 <--topic_cb-- node1
