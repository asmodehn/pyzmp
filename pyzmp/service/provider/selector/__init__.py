# This package contains different low level event handling systems.
# It is useful only for python < 3.X, before asyncio abstracted all of it.

# Reference : https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html#module-selectors

# if python version >= 3.4
# By default we use python standard selectors module

# but if some specific selector is already setup, we should use this one instead
